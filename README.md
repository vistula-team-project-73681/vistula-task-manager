## Supabase setup

Create a `tasks` table with an identity primary key named `id`, a required text column named `title`, a text column named `description`, and a boolean column named `completed` with a default of `false`. Add the public demonstration CRUD policies required by the assignment, then set `supabaseUrl` and the public publishable key in `config.json`.

Only a public publishable key belongs in this frontend configuration. Never add a secret or service-role key.
